# Tom's ACF Fields

This plug-in adds some extra ACF Field Types that are not available in the base plug-in.

## Website URL

This field will automatically strip the web protocol entered (e.g. "http") and set it to "https" when you save the post, so it's always using a secure protocol.

It's also styled in a way that shows the "https://" prepend before the input.
